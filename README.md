Description
===========

This cookbook exists to achieve a deployment of a Priam [1] Managed Cassandra [2] Cluster Deployment.

This cookbook creates the necessary SimpleDB databases [3] to manage the deployment along with some Priam/Cassandra configuration properties [4] managed via chef attributes.

This cookbook also includes Datastax OpsCentre [2] which provides a monitoring dashboard.

This cookbook installs an Oracle JRE and the JNA package.

Special Notes: This cookbook and the software it deploys are only designed to work under AWS with Autoscaling Groups.

See [Priam][1] for more details.
